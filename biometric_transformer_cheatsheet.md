    Q_a = linear_q(x_a)  # Query from modality A
    K_b = linear_k(x_b)  # Keys from modality B
    V_b = linear_v(x_b)  # Values from modality B

    attn_weights = softmax(Q_a @ K_b.transpose(-2,-1) / sqrt(D))
    output = attn_weights @ V_b
    return output
```

**Multi-Stream Processing**
```python
def multi_modal_transformer_block(face_tokens, voice_tokens, fingerprint_tokens):
    # Self-attention within each modality
    face_out = self_attention(face_tokens)
    voice_out = self_attention(voice_tokens)
    fingerprint_out = self_attention(fingerprint_tokens)

    # Cross-attention between modalities
    face_voice = cross_attention(face_out, voice_out)
    face_fingerprint = cross_attention(face_out, fingerprint_out)
    voice_fingerprint = cross_attention(voice_out, fingerprint_out)

    # Fusion and final processing
