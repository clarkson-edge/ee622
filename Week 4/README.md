[![Week 4 Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Week%204-Open%20in%20Colab-blue?logo=google-colab)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/clarkson-edge/ee622/blob/main/Week%204/lab/Week4_FaceBiometrics.ipynb)

[‚Üê Back to Course Main](../README.md) | [‚Üê Week 3](../Week%203/README.md) | [‚Üí Week 5](../Week%205/README.md)

## Overview
This week explores how Vision Transformers (ViT) revolutionize facial recognition by treating face images as sequences of patches. Students will implement ViT architectures for face recognition, compare them with traditional CNN approaches, and visualize how transformers attend to different facial features.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this week, students will be able to:
- Understand ViT architecture and its adaptation for face biometrics
- Implement face image patching and position encoding strategies
- Build transformer-based face recognition and verification systems
- Visualize and interpret facial feature attention patterns
- Compare ViT performance with CNN-based face recognition
- Integrate transformers with existing face recognition pipelines

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Highlights

#### Face Preprocessing Pipeline
```python
def preprocess_face_for_vit(image_path, target_size=224):
    """Detect, align, and prepare face for ViT"""
    # Detect face
    face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
    
    # Align face using facial landmarks
    face_landmarks = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
    aligned_face = align_face(image, face_landmarks)
    
    # Resize and normalize
    face_tensor = transform(aligned_face)
    return face_tensor
```

#### ViT Architecture for Faces
```python
class FaceViT(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, img_size=224, patch_size=16, embed_dim=768):
        super().__init__()
        self.patch_embed = PatchEmbed(img_size, patch_size, embed_dim)
        self.pos_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, num_patches + 1, embed_dim))
        self.cls_token = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, 1, embed_dim))
        
        # Transformer blocks
        self.blocks = nn.ModuleList([
            Block(embed_dim, num_heads=12, mlp_ratio=4.0)
            for _ in range(depth)
        ])
        
        # Face-specific head
        self.face_head = nn.Linear(embed_dim, num_identities)
```

#### Attention Visualization
```python
def visualize_face_attention(model, face_image, layer_idx=-1):
    """Visualize which facial regions the model focuses on"""
    # Get attention weights
    _, attentions = model(face_image, output_attentions=True)
    
    # Average attention across heads
    attention_map = attentions[layer_idx].mean(dim=1)
    
    # Reshape to image dimensions
    attention_img = attention_map.reshape(14, 14)
    attention_img = F.interpolate(attention_img, size=(224, 224))
    
    # Overlay on original face
    return overlay_attention(face_image, attention_img)
```

## üìä Results and Analysis

    # Add facial region bias
    facial_regions = define_facial_regions()  # Eyes, nose, mouth areas
    for region, weight in facial_regions.items():
        pos_embed[region] *= weight
        
    return pos_embed

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### "Out of Memory with ViT"
```python
# Reduce batch size
batch_size = 16  # Instead of 32

# Use gradient accumulation
accumulation_steps = 4

# Mixed precision training
from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler
scaler = GradScaler()
```

### "Poor Face Detection"
```python
# Try multiple detectors
detectors = ['dlib', 'mtcnn', 'retinaface']
for detector in detectors:
    faces = detect_faces(image, detector=detector)
    if len(faces) > 0:
        break
```

### "Attention Visualization Unclear"
```python
# Use later layers for clearer patterns
attention = model.get_attention(layer=-2)  # Second to last

# Apply threshold for clarity
attention[attention < 0.1] = 0

# Use different colormap
plt.imshow(attention, cmap='jet', alpha=0.5)
```
