## Lab: Attention Visualization Demo

### Objectives
- Extract attention maps from pre-trained Vision Transformers
- Visualize attention patterns across biometric modalities (face, fingerprint, iris)
- Compare attention evolution across transformer layers
- Identify biometrically significant regions

### Implementation Steps
1. Load pre-trained ViT model and biometric samples
2. Understand tokenization and patch-based processing
3. Extract attention maps from transformer layers
4. Visualize CLS token attention patterns
5. Analyze attention across different layers
6. Compare patterns across biometric modalities
7. Identify feature importance through attention

### Sample Code Structure
```python
# Load model and data
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224")
face_img = load_biometric_sample("your data here")

# Extract attention
attention_maps = get_attention_maps(model, face_img)

# Visualize attention patterns
visualize_cls_attention(face_img, attention_maps)
```

## Discussion Questions
1. How do transformer attention mechanisms compare to human visual attention in biometric recognition?
2. What advantages do transformers offer for cross-demographic biometric fairness?
3. How can attention visualization improve biometric system security?
4. What deployment challenges exist for transformer-based biometric systems?

## Assignment
Complete the attention visualization lab and prepare a brief analysis of attention patterns across the three biometric modalities. Identify which regions receive the most attention and hypothesize why these areas are important for identity recognition.

## Next Week Preview
Week 2 will focus on transformer models specifically for fingerprint feature extraction, building on the attention visualization concepts learned this week.
