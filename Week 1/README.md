## üß™ Lab: Attention Visualization Demo

### Objectives
- Extract attention maps from pre-trained Vision Transformers
- Visualize attention patterns across biometric modalities (face, fingerprint, iris)
- Compare attention evolution across transformer layers
- Identify biometrically significant regions through attention analysis

### Implementation Highlights
```python
# Core implementation pattern
model = ViTForImageClassification.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224")
biometric_image = load_sample_image()

# Extract multi-layer attention maps
attention_maps = extract_attention_maps(model, biometric_image)

# Visualize CLS token attention patterns
visualize_cls_attention(biometric_image, attention_maps)

# Compare attention across biometric modalities
compare_attention_patterns(face_img, fingerprint_img, iris_img)
```

### Key Features Demonstrated
- **Multi-Modal Analysis**: Face, fingerprint, and iris attention patterns
- **Layer-Wise Evolution**: How attention develops through transformer layers
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying critical regions for biometric recognition
- **Visualization Techniques**: Heatmaps, attention rollout, and head analysis

## üí≠ Discussion Questions
1. How do transformer attention mechanisms compare to human visual attention in biometric recognition?
2. What advantages do transformers offer for cross-demographic biometric fairness?
3. How can attention visualization improve biometric system security and interpretability?
4. What deployment challenges exist for transformer-based biometric systems?

## üìù Assignment
Complete the attention visualization lab and prepare a brief analysis of attention patterns across the three biometric modalities. Identify which regions receive the most attention and hypothesize why these areas are important for identity recognition.

**Deliverables:**
- Completed notebook with attention visualizations
- Identification of biometrically significant regions

## üîÑ Next Week Preview
Week 2 will focus on transformer models specifically for fingerprint feature extraction and matching, building on the attention visualization concepts learned this week. You'll implement hybrid CNN-transformer architectures and work with real fingerprint datasets.
